This paper enables a clear and uniform understanding of the related research, in three ways. Firstly, it surveys a broad range of relevant research, describing and contrasting the approaches of each using a uniform terminological and conceptual vocabulary. Secondly, it identifies and discusses three commonly advocated principles within this work: component models, first-class connection and loose coupling. Thirdly, it identifies and compares the various modularisation strategies employed by the surveyed work.},

This brand-new text covers all facets of software architecture and how it serves as the intellectual centerpiece of software development and evolution. Critically, this text focuses on supporting creation of real implemented systems. Hence the text details not only modeling techniques, but design, implementation, deployment, and system adaptation -- as well as a host of other topics -- putting the elements in context and comparing and contrasting them with one another. Rather than focusing on one method, notation, tool, or process, this new text/reference widely surveys software architecture techniques, enabling the instructor and practitioner to choose the right tool for the job at hand. Software Architecture is intended for upper-division undergraduate and graduate courses in software architecture, software design, component-based software engineering, and distributed systems; the text 
may also be used in introductory as well as advanced software engineering courses.},

@article{canal2001compatibility,
abstract = {The application of formal methods to the development of software depends on the availability of adequate models and formalisms for each of the stages of the development process. In this work, we focus on the level of design called Software Architecture. At this level, the system is described as a collection of interrelated components, and it is here where the properties derived from the system's structure can be naturally analyzed. Our approach uses process algebras as a formal basis for the description and analysis of software architectures. Process algebras are widely accepted for the specification of software systems. In particular, $\pi$-calculus addresses the description of systems with a dynamic or evolving topology, and permits their analysis for bisimilarity and other interesting properties. Though bisimilarity determines the equivalence of behavior, more flexible relations are needed in the context of Software Engineering, in order to support formally the notions of conformance and 
refinement of behavior. In this paper we present a relation of compatibility in the context of $\pi$-calculus which formalizes the notion of conformance of behavior between software components. Our approach is enhanced with the definition of a relation of inheritance among processes. This relation preserves compatibility and indicates whether a process can be considered as a specialization or extension of another one. The suitability of our approach is shown by its application to the field of Software Architecture.},

abstract = "AbstractContext Usability is an important software quality attribute for APIs. Unfortunately, measuring it is not an easy task since many things like experienced evaluators, suitable test users, and a functional product are needed. This makes existing usability measurement methods difficult to use, especially for non-professionals. Objective To make \{API\} usability measurement easier, an automated and objective measurement method would be needed. This article proposes such a method. Since it would be impossible to find and integrate all possible factors that influence \{API\} usability in one step, the main goal is to prove the feasibility of the introduced approach, and to define an extensible framework so that additional factors can easily be defined and added later. Method A literature review is conducted to find potential factors influencing \{API\} usability. From these factors, a selected few are investigated more closely with usability studies. The statistically evaluated results from these studies are used to define specific elements of the introduced framework. Further, the influence of the user as a critical factor for the framework’s feasibility is evaluated. Results The \{API\} Concepts Framework is defined, with an extensible structure based on concepts that represent the user’s actions, measurable properties that define what influences the usability of these concepts, and learning effects that represent the influence of the user’s experience. A comparison of values calculated by the framework with user studies shows promising results. Conclusion It is concluded that the introduced approach is feasible and provides useful results for evaluating \{API\} usability. The extensible framework easily allows to add new concepts and measurable properties in the future. "

abstract="Today, when constructing software systems, many developers build their systems on top of frameworks. Eclipse is such a framework that has been in existence for over a decade. Like many other evolving software systems, the Eclipse platform has both stable and supported interfaces (``good'') and unstable, discouraged and unsupported interfaces (``bad''). In this study, we investigate Eclipse interface usage by Eclipse third-party plug-ins (ETPs) based on whether they use bad interfaces or not. The investigations, based on empirical analysis present the following observations. First, we discovered that 44 {\%} of the 512 analyzed Eclipse third-party plug-ins depend on ``bad'' interfaces and that developers continue to use ``bad'' interfaces. Second, we have observed that plug-ins that use or extend at least one ``bad'' interface are comparatively larger and use more functionality from Eclipse than those that use only ``good'' interfaces. Third, the findings show that the ETPs use a diverse set of ``bad'' interfaces. Fourth, we observed that the reason why the bad interfaces are being eliminated from the ETPs' source code is, because (ETP developers believe) these non-APIs will cause incompatibilities when a version of the ETP is ported to new Eclipse SDK release. Finally, we observed that when developers eliminate problematic ``bad'' interfaces, they either re-implement the same functionality in their own API, find equivalent SDK good interfaces, or completely delete the entities in the ETPs' source code that use the functionality from the ``bad'' interfaces.",
